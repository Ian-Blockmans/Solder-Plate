The inserts for the displays are M2-> Length 2.5mm, M2xOD3.0

Use 4mm long M4 screws (metal)

Imporant:
Print the Guard from ABS or ASA-> Need high temp resistence.

Top and bottom part snap on.

This print is HARD. Not for begginers. Need to clean support and sand off the suport marks. Should be printed face down.

For the LED's use a 2mm acrylic rod cut to length to help guide the light from the LED to the top of the case.

For the buttons you got 2 options.

1: Print Extenders for the caps (3.5mm ID, 5mm OD)
2: Buy longer buttons and buy caps from them if you wanna make it look pro.
