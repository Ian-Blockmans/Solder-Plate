# Solder Plate Controller with Detachable Hotplate

This repository contains the source code and design files for a Solder Plate Controller and detachable hotplate. Processor used is ATmega4809 and is based on the work of DerSpatz: https://github.com/DerSpatz/PCB-reflow-solder-heat-plate


## Features
- Precise temperature control for soldering SMD components. with support of **up to 6 thermistors**.
- Cheap and widely available MCU- Atmega4809 and low BOM cost
- Custom PCB design with 2 version: Single area control (Completed) and 4 independent heating zones control(In works)
- Detacbale hotplate allows for use of new heatplate designs including larger ones
- Programming via USB
- PlatformIO integration for streamlined development.
- wifi via esp8266-12f module (with wifi version - In Development).
- Based on Reflow Hotplate by DerSpatz with some improvements
- Oled for menu navigation, debbuging and thermistor info
- TFT for reflow profile target and actual temp
- 4 buttons for menu nativation
- Current sense IC for current monitoring
- 3 indicator LED's. They work for both menu and REFLOW profiles (Blinking while on the current stage and solid once profile stage is complete)
- Buzzer for complete notification
- Buck- Converter for input voltage allowing up to 24V in
- 24V+ rated input voltage stage components allowing theoretcally up to 24V to be used (not yet tested)
- Optional fan for cooling stage (Not yet implimted)
- Included files for a case and guard for the detachable plate terminal guard

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

- PlatformIO Core or PlatformIO IDE.
- ATmega4809 microcontroller.
- Basic soldering tools and electronic assembly skills.
- Access to a PCB manufacturing service.

### Hardware Setup

1. **PCB Fabrication:** Fabricate the PCB using the provided design files.
2. **Component Assembly:** Solder the components onto the PCB as per the schematic.
3. **Power Supply Connection:** Connect a suitable power supply. 12V 5A tested, 24v 5A compatible. Use of more then 5A requires a appropriate FUSE to be chosen and solder on place of F1

### Preparing the ATmega4809

Before programming the ATmega4809, it needs to be flashed with a default bootloader.

1. **Bootloader Flashing:**

Same process as DerSpatz Solder plate (Direct quote):

The MCU can be programmed with JTAG2UPDI (https://github.com/ElTangas/jtag2updi). For programming, you need an Arduino with ATMEGA328p (Uno or Nano), some wires, a 4.7k resistor and a 10ÂµF capacitor or 120 Ohm resistor to disable the auto-reset.

JCM from the Discord explained the process pretty good:

- Download/Clone this project: https://github.com/ElTangas/jtag2updi and rename the folder "source" to "jtag2updi" (otherwise the Arduino IDE won't like it)
- Open jtag2updi/jtag2updi.ino in your Arduino IDE
- Configure the flasher options for your Arduino Nano and flash it
- Connect D6 of your Arduino Nano over the 4.7kOhm resistor to the UPDI pin of the board and 5V to 5V and GND to 0V
- Add the MegaCoreX hardware package to the Ardunio IDE (see https://github.com/MCUdude/MegaCoreX#how-to-install)
- Install the Adafruit_GFX, Adafruit_SSD1306, DallasTemperature and Debounce2 libraries with the Library Manager (you might not need all of them depending on which firmware you plan to use)
- Download and open the ino you want to upload to the ATMEGA4809 (https://github.com/DerSpatz/PCB-reflow-solder-heat-plate/blob/main/Firmware/pcb_reflow_fw/pcb_reflow_fw.ino)
- Select the options for the programmer (Board: ATmega4809, Clock: Internal 16 MHz, BOD: 2.6V or 2.7V, EEPROM: retained, Pinout: 48 pin standard, Reset pin: Reset, Bootloader:Optiboot:Uart0(Defualt pins)) and select the port of your Ardunio Nano as Port
- Make sure the programmer selected is SerialUPDI
- Select Burn Bootloader and see if it runs through


2. **MicroUSB Programming And Firmware Upload:**

   - Using Platformio:
   1. After flashing the bootloader, the ATmega4809 can be programmed via the microUSB connection using PlatformIO by building the project and upload

   // Use a AVR programmer or the jtag2updi modified arduino nano/uno menitoned above
   - Using AVRDude
   1. Folow instructions on : https://github.com/ElTangas/jtag2updi?tab=readme-ov-file#using-with-avrdude
   - Using AVRDUDESS (AVRDUDE with GUI interface) -- This section many not be completley finished
   1. Download and install AVRDUDE 6.3 :https://download-mirror.savannah.gnu.org/releases/avrdude/
   2. Download AVRDUDESS : https://github.com/ZakKemble/AVRDUDESS
   3. Download the custom Avrdude config: https://svn.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/*checkout*/avrdude/trunk/avrdude/avrdude.conf.in?revision=1422
   4. Select the custom avrdude.conf from Option ->  avrdude.conf - > choose where you downloaded the custom conf file
   5. Choose the programmer as jtag2updi 
   6. Choose the COMPORT where the jtag2updi modified arduino is connected to
   7. Choose the Flash binary under the precomplied binary directory -> set to Write
   8. Press Go


### Software Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arwidcool/Solder-Plate
   cd Solder-Plate
2. **Import in vscode**
To open a PlatformIO project in VSCode with the PlatformIO extension, follow these steps:

1. Launch VSCode and ensure that you have the PlatformIO extension installed. If not, you can install it from the VSCode marketplace.
2. Open the VSCode command palette by pressing Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+P (Mac).
3. In the command palette, type "PlatformIO: Open" and select the "PlatformIO: Open" command from the list.
4. Navigate to the root folder of your PlatformIO project using the file explorer that appears.
5. Select the folder and click "Open" to open the PlatformIO project in VSCode.


### Usage

Power On: Connect the controller with a 12V 5A(Tested working) or 24V 5A PSU (Untested)
Set Profile: Navigate the menu and choose the desired reflow profile
Start Soldering: Place your PCB and components on the hotplate and start the profile

### Customization

Feel free to modify the firmware and PCB design to suit your specific needs.
